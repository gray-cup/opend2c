          <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-3">
            Open D2C is a product discovery and aggregation platform for Indian direct-to-consumer (D2C)
            brands, owned and operated by Gray Cup Enterprises (Open D2C Enterprises Private Limited).
            We index publicly available product data from seller websites — sitemaps, product feeds,
            and structured data — and surface it in a searchable marketplace.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-600">
            <strong>We do not sell products.</strong> We do not process payments. We do not hold inventory.
            When you find a product on Open D2C, you are redirected to the original brand's website to complete
            your purchase. The transaction is entirely between you and that brand.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-600">
            By accessing or using Open D2C — whether as a buyer browsing products or a seller listing
            your brand — you agree to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, please do not use the platform.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">3. Free Listing for Brands</h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-3">
            Listing your D2C brand and products on Open D2C is <strong>free</strong>. There are no
            upfront fees, no listing fees, and no commission charged on any purchase — because we are a
            discovery platform, not a marketplace that processes transactions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-600">
            We may introduce optional paid tiers in the future — such as priority placement, verified
            brand badges, or enhanced analytics — but the core listing will always remain free. You will
            be notified of any changes before they take effect.

          <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-3">
            Open D2C may display advertising on its pages. Advertising revenue helps cover the platform's
            server costs and funds ongoing improvements — it is how we keep the core product free for
            brands and buyers. This may include:

            do not influence editorial decisions, product indexing, or organic search ranking.
